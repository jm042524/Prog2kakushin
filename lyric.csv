Thinkin Bout You,"TranslationsTürkçeEspañolРусскийPolskiFrançaisThinkin Bout You Lyrics[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?

Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)

We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you

Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin

Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then

If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then

No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then

You showed me love
Glory from above

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the rooves
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

[Chorus]
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above

To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult

Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, ""Don't let the high go to waste""
But can you taste a little taste?

So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards

Frank Ocean’s Open Letter on Tumblr,"Frank Ocean’s Open Letter on Tumblr LyricsBASEDGOD WAS RIGHT. we’re all a bunch of golden million dollar babies. my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did. anyhow, what i’m about to post is for anyone who cares to read. it was intended to fill the thank you’s section in my album credits, but with all the rumors going round.. I figured it’d be good to clarify…

Whoever you are. Wherever you are… I’m starting to think we’re a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness. All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I’ve screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow. 4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile. I’d hear his conversation and his silence…until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with. I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak. I realised too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though. I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth. I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself. He patted my back. He said kind things. He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon, it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn’t tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I’d only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn’t on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn’t imagine keeping up my life without him. I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn’t always successful

The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It’s winter now. I’m typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It’s December 27, 2011. By now I’ve written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I’m surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I’d told some people my story. I’m sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I don’t know what happens now, and that’s alrite. I don’t have any secrets I need kept anymore. There’s probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don’t think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I’m grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn’t what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I won’t forget you. I won’t forget the summer. I’ll remember who I was when I met you. I’ll remember who you were and how we’ve both changed and stayed the same. I’ve never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I’m only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too

Remember when all I had was my mother

Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

You still are no match, you get no rematch

Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman, Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though

Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

Having you around
It's all new to me

What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is, it's flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

[Bridge]
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can’t hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say

Wither,"TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsWither Lyrics[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there’s no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
All tonight, I’ll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring, when flowers bloom
Hope they’ll get to see my color
Know that I’ve enjoyed sunshine
Pray they’ll get to see me, me wither (When I was young)
See me wither (When I was young)
[Outro: Frank Ocean & Jazmine Sullivan]

Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain

And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you

To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be drug through mud

I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt in law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Barefeet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok classics
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Maxes
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural
This what I would do just to show you
That it's special now

No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale

Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again
[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time

[Verse 2]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again

[Hook]
Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it

But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart

[Verse 2]
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazal tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight then what's this buff shit even ‘bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright, bright, bright, bright

[Verse 3]
I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop
The bleeding I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, “No homo”
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time they enforced a bias
You know like some cops stop and frisk a guy
‘Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different
Sets, twin siblings, head spinning
Exorcist

The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic Churches, the masses was quiet as mice so
The minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent I thought I heard Christ go
'You need a messiah'
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East by my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetle-bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait because it's no rush
Clouds floating over oceans from above

Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me

That explains the meaning of life

Tumblr/Magazine Note,"Tumblr/Magazine Note LyricsTwo years ago I found an image of a kid with her hands covering her face. A seatbelt reached across her torso, riding up her neck and a mop of blonde hair stayed swept, for the moment, behind her ears. Her eyes seemed clear and calm but not blank, the road behind her seemed the same. I put myself in her seat then I played it all out in my head. The claustrophobia hits as the seatbelt tightens, preventing me from even leaning forward in my seat. the pressing on internal organs. I lean back and forward to release it. Then backwards and forward again. There it is—I got free. How much of my life has happened inside of a car? I wonder if the odds are that I'll die in one. Knock on wood-grain. Shouldn’t speak like that. We live in cars in some cities, commuting across space either for our livelihood, or devouring fossil fuels for joy. It's close to as much time as we spend in our beds, more for some. The first time I did shrooms, my manager had to come rescue me from Caltech’s ‘Trip Day.’ As I got into her car, I swear to God the aluminum center console in her Porsche truck looked like it was breathing, like the throat of something. On the freeway, leaving Pasadena, we spoke and I looked away, outside, at the wheels and tires of cars doing that optical illusion thing they do where it looks like they’re spinning backwards, which, according to Google, happens because our brains are assuming something completely wrong and showing it to us. Staring, I was transfixed by all the indicator lights oscillating and throbbing against the wind. We drove thru downtown LA headed west, flying on the same freeways I used to run outta gas on. Welcomed in by the perennial creatures, imperial palm trees and climbing vines living their lives out just off the shoulder. The feeling familiar enhanced, on the 10. I used to ride around in my sinewy crossover SUV, smoke and listen to rough mixes of my old shit before it came out, or whatever someone wanted to play when they hooked up their iPhone to the aux cord. A few years and few daily-drivers later I'm not driving much anymore. It's been a year since I moved to London, at the time of writing this, and there's no practical reason to drive in this city. I ordered a GT3 RS and it'll keep low miles out here but I guess it's good to have in case of emergency :) Raf Simons once told me it was cliché, my whole car obsession. Maybe it links to a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy. Consciously though, I don't want straight—a little bent is good. I found it romantic, sometimes, editing this project. The whole time I felt as though I was in the presence of a $16m McLaren F1 armed with a disposable camera. My memories are in these pages, places closeby and long ass-numbing flights away. Cruising the suburbs of Tokyo in RWB Porsches. Throwing parties around England and mobbing freeways in four project M3S that I built with some friends. Going to Mississippi and playing in the mud with amphibious quads. Street-casting models at a random kung fu dojo out in Senegal. Commissioning life-size toy boxes for the fuck of it. Shooting a music video for fun with Tyrone Lebon, the genius giant. Taking a break/reconnaissance mission to Tulum, Mexico, enjoying some star visibility for a change. Recording in Tokyo, NYC, Miami, LA, London, Paris. Stopping in Berlin to witness Berghain for myself. Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BasedGod in conversation. I wrote a story in the middle—It’s called “Godspeed.” It's basically a reimagined part of my boyhood. Boys do cry, but I don't think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It's surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. Surprising, to me, because the current phase is what I was asking the cosmos for when I was a kid. Maybe that part had its rough stretches too, but in my rearview mirror it's getting small enough to convince myself it was all good. And really though... It's still all goodYou might also like8Embed"

Day Away,"Day Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cos it's still so hard to live with it

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more
[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Verse 2]
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna' clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed

See you peepin' out the peep hole
Gamblin' with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo
Three stripes and they're all green gold
Three strikes in a row mean go
And you die slow, oh

I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson
I'm screamin' from the top of the planet
They first saw my swag, they was laughin'
But my bitch bad, she leavin' damage
I'm higher than a mothafuckin' ladder
I'm ballin', I'm ballin' on all you scrubs
Got you ridin' in your foreign, you livin' it up
Front's 21's and the back's on them dubs
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub
Ridin' in the Rozay away from the world
Oasis on and I'm feelin' a grudge
Oasis on when I'm seein' you girl
Oasis on and I'm seein' the dust
Oasis on and I'm feelin' like water
Oasis on when I'm servin' the plugs
Oasis on when I'm servin' these drugs
Off white molly, I sniff it off her
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz
All white hoes puttin' dick in their guts
All type of hoes puttin' dick in their guts
Bad black hoes, they drinkin' the cum
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a lil' some

Waitin' on you to tire
Retire with victory, play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you lowkey sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-haha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waitin' for my downfall
They're like ""something's gotta give""

Sucka for Love (Alternate Version),"Sucka for Love (Alternate Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I told her that I missed her, put her on a plane
Goyard luggage, just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, she grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same

And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one

Could have my name, girl if you want

See baby I been looking so long
Feel like you let me shy and wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love

You knew that it was over, wasn't feeling them at all
Cause baby I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love

Summer lovin' in the winter, flaming in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking with me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious you're my everything, no please don't leave me lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good, she wish that it would stay

That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice cause his wind gone
Nigga sound like Reggie
If life is a woman them walls gone
They ran through her already

I'm thinking
My life is a virgin like wife in all white and
Tonight I'm determined
To give her insight, eat her right till she creams
'Till she writhes with delight
Ándale ándale, make her pray to the pipe
Make her worship that false phallic idle
I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow
I'm mindful of size
She's chockful of my swipe like a capsule
Sealed tight with that substance you need
Start a family tonight
In this Camry we might
Mean this big body Merc with the leather
Oak and the LED lights
That I don't even drive
I'm in London tonight
And it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in
From the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich
Or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they watchin' my fence
Like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope
Got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow

If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don’t let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you’re not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That’s why I never sleep with my back to you
[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 2]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don’t go
Baby, the worst jail is
Waking up alone in a world where you’re not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I’m looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)

Were we at the rave, dancing horribly
Pulse went through my face and my clear backpack
Sonic sound you made me
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Hope you don't think I'm easy
What starts inside these hallways
Always comes and goes
I come from nothing
Like you come from nothing
Light like a laser cut from the navel
Til it's dark as a plum
Back where we're from
Don't take life so serious
If you find another
He could sleep right here
Between the two of us
I'll move over some
I hope he doesn't think I'm easy
Between the three of us
There's no one sleeping cold
Nobody said it would be easy
With you on my mind
I'm scared to think alone
Ohh why was it never this easy
The windows raise to show us
Daylight's come againYou might also like2Embed"

I’m knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold

Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it’s a chore
But I won’t stop loving you that’s for sure, that’s for sure

This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no

I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I’m still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you’d just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that’s a start

You could open your window baby

She didn't have to do much, but she made me smile

Broken Pieces,"Broken Pieces Lyrics[Verse 1]
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts

One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids
On a facelift
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'll drop you off and in a few months
We'll talk again
When you need a break
Which part of the circle will you stand on
You keep doing the dance wrong

I'm sure we're taller in other dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving
Your body's aching
We should vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're okay here, we're doing fine

You dream of walls that hold us in prison

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 1)","Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 1) LyricsSteely walks down a street with the pace of someone with some place to go but who has left early enough to get there. He holds a rectangular metallic card smaller than his palms with grooves on its surface. The street is quiet, the sidewalk clean. As he walks, he occasionally slows to peer inside the windows of parked cars. The cars have a familiar look though it’s obvious their designs are several generations ahead. The elegant lines, the materials and tech apparent in the construction are the result of years of engineering advances beyond the present.

The city feels simultaneously old and new, weathered by time and progress, lending it a distinctive quality. A modern city embracing technology but somewhat overtaken by nature, still trying to find a balance. There are pick-ups and wagons amongst the luxury cars, very democratic. Steely peers into a car with a cigarette in the ashtray. Using the metallic card, he swipes it against the car’s access strip and gains entry. He steals the cig, lights it and walks a few cars down. He notices a hanging air freshener in another car and decides he likes it, breaks into that car as well taking the fragrant contraband. The stillness is mesmerizing, you can barely hear the autobahn in the distance or the steps of his companion just a few feet ahead.

Caged court centered in a park somewhat densely populated with live oak trees, their limbs perfectly frame rather than reach above the court. Clark is around 5’10” or 11”, lean but strapping and towering compared to a seemingly younger Steely who just beamed a ball at Clark and nearly landed a punch before Robb and Matthew body-blocked.  Clark would have hurt him, badly, obviously, as Steely is a few years younger and developing a physique to match his mental toughness.

     Robb: ‘Whoa whoa whoa level down…’
     Matthew: ‘Kiss and make up, friends. It’s a contact sport.’
     Steely: ‘Nah, miss me with that, he always tryna big man somebody.’
     Clark: (Checks his face for blood. Spits.) ‘Game point.’
Steely steps up to guard him, placing his hand on Clark’s side to telegraph his movements. Clark crosses him, drives and lays the ball up, winning the game.

     Clark: ‘Whoo! (RIC FLAIR voice) Did you feel that? Did you sense the sublime finesse and technique just then? You should be grateful. You should be grateful for me. Here.’
     Steely: ‘Blah, blah, blah.’ (Shrugs and mimes, picks the dead basketball up off the ground and does a tricky slam dunk with excess energy.)

The quiet of the morning scene continues, Steely and Shoobie continue walking as if in a dream. No birds, no other people, no sounds of cars. You see cars though, and you can hear a faint wind occasionally disrupt the silence as it passes between the rubber of the vehicles and the concrete. The skyline is a blended ecosystem of the natural world and school buildings. Tall structures of glass, steel, brick and mortar raised on stilts of a hard clear substance. Limbs of trees reaching out through some windows, you see entire floors made into greenhouses and pocket jungles sprawling off rooftops. They approach a park where we see a sculpture of a child hanging from the sky from a string that goes up forever, touching the surface of a never ending rippling pond below with the tip of his finger. There are no paths of stone or concrete, the grounds are riddled with ever so slight inclines and valleys. There’s a large Olympic sized pool built with Carrara marble, students ice skate it during the winter and skateboard in it in warmer months.

Shoobie walks slowly ahead of Steely, carrying a slate of metal, head held high, inhaling deeply and gratefully from a harmless, flavored steam cigarette. She squints her large eyes eyes on a toke and looks back at Steely going inside of someone else’s car.  The colors of her eyes change. She keeps walking. Steely catches up and throws his arm around Shoobie — he quickly takes his arm back to himself then grabs both her elbows and turns her toward him.

     Shoobie: (Bobbing her head to music that isn't playing, she sings) 'That's the way everyday goes, every time we've no control...'

Steely looks up at the sky. A wide, flat translucent aircraft is coasting slowly above, leaving clouds in its wake and filtering sunlight into beautiful prismatic refractions onto him.

He's looking down at Shoobie, she's wearing radiation protective gear. Her helmet is mirrored orange and red, the suit has a white body. He focuses on her and not the campus being destroyed behind her by fire.

     Steely: ‘Is death a high? I heard it’s like DMT. The guy who told me that isn’t dead. Maybe it’s worth dying. The high I mean. Worst part about it though. We won’t remember being so tight you know? Look at us!’

(Brushes imaginary locks from his face)

     Shoobie: ‘...uhh?’

Steely looks down at his feet and there’s ice on the grass though it’s summer. Steely pulls his head up to say ‘snow’ but doesn’t even make the begining sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white encoded with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its pole. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. ‘If you could fly then you’d feel south, up north’s gettin’ cold soon…The way it is were on land — still i’m someone to hold true’.1Embed"

Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late

I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers

I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind
Maybe I'm a fool
And maybe I should move

Forgetting there's a jungle outside
Nah

An idea from another man's mind (Mind)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind

You gotta leave

Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It’s just gon’ happen
I don’t understand it
My heart’s sane
But my mind’s going crazy
[Chorus]
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave

Oh, just go
No stay, go

Dear April (Justice Remix),"Dear April (Justice Remix) Lyrics[Verse]
Dear April, the only face in the crowd that I know
Dear April, are you watchin' him?
Are you watchin' him dance?
Dear April, we were safe for a while
We were safe as the years flew by
If you could take two strangers
Lead them left and right
At a certain place
In time, like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
I believe no matter what
Take us through it
And wake us up again
And what we had can't be the same now
Just like you made me new
Just like you took me through it
Just like you woke me up
You made me new
Took me through it
Woke me up
You woke me up

Go for it

[Verse 1]
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody, being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporate
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G!)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some pussy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right, you know I won't need you
And I tell you (Biiitch!)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that, I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation, can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You were from my past life, hope you're doing well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first, signal coming in and out (Huh?)
Hope you're doing well, bruh
Everybody needs you

Oooh, nani nani (Ooh, nani, oh)
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body, ugh!

The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being late on me
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, everyday shit

Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend-the-night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that nana, though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
Every night shit
Night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit

[Verse 2]
Bubble goose down, blue punch
Pocari Sweat, ghost sweat
Her wet wet, her mouth wet, two things I don't regret
My dick long, memory long, two things she don't forget
Game drives so wet, my Black friends just wear black
But only fly in black jets, if it's roulette, black's best
Niggas ain't sold crack yet
Flyin' private, ain't wasting seats
Niggas lapped up in that bitch
Black bodies in the summer breeze
Runnin' four flats, tryna get in the lead
Tryna get in the league and play wide receiver
Nigga, pass the sticks, call winners winners
Up-seat, gotta walk it off
Winners hate to lose, gotta run they mouth
Sets thrown, now they lockin' up
We ain't break it up
Tryna see who face getting knotted up
That was Monday, we was back friends on Tuesday
Still talkin' 'bout it 'til this day
Need fifty hunnas, that's 5 racks
Hit Costco, keep the fam fat
Fuck a weed-man, grow your own plants
Tell the cashier give you five blacks and the purple packs
Some loud burnin' out on the grill
Black Adonis on the diving board
Gainers only, I'm bringing Guinness
Jordans floatin' on the deep end of the pool (Yes)
Somebody got thrown in again, y'all are fools
Phone drown on the concrete in the summer blaze
Blaze too, blaze too

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 3)","Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 3) LyricsSteely and Matthew split up in a corridor and go into different classrooms that are stand-alone trailers.

In one class, a smooth but occasionally glitchy 3-D projection of a teacher greets Steely. The teacher is severe in appearance and manner. Though her projection corresponds to a live human being somewhere else on the planet, she might as well be a robot or at least the ghost of a human once capable of warm emotion.

     Teacher: 'Punctuality appears to be your Achilles' heel, Mr. Grude. Alas, you've cleared H3, admirable. Quiet your ears, then solve the riddle.'

The teacher trails away.

Steely exhales loudly. Takes his bag off and hangs it on a hook. There is a digital 24-hour clock in the top left corner, it's black steel with white numbers. The walls are covered in floral wallpaper, overhead there's a clear paneled mechanical ceiling. The mahogany floors ramp up to class seating, with curves and layers dynamically represented. A wall for projection wrapped in a semi circle lies at the head of the class.

Steely breathes in deeply, dropping his shoulders. The room is so quiet. He closes his eyes. A montage flashing in his head: Shoobie's mouth, himself as a small boy calling up from a pit, fencing, climbing a fence, running. A small quiet click comes into his ears from a clock. The memory of his father first forgetting while giving a lecture at his school. The silence. The stutter. The angry burst at someone touching his arm. He remembers his father not remembering him. His mother throwing things out of focus. The canopied street. The first car he stole on a spinning platter. His father's car.
Steely is mumbling a mantra and slowly his memories whitewash away. He opens his eyes and he is seated on a chair in full lotus. He breaks position and pulls a tray out of a side compartment and now he has a surface with a bowl in its center, a few gauges and a small loupe. It's what seems to be a mini solar system that he's manipulating with the gauges.

The teacher swarms back in and places a decades-old transparency paper on a projector.

The riddle:

     Teacher: 'You poured it hot and you're stirring it up, now what's moving faster, the tea or the cup?'
     Steely: 'The tea.'
     Teacher: What's harder Mr. Grude, a liquid or a solid?'
     Steely: 'Shit'
     Teacher: 'Of course. And what does your understanding of physics inform you of as it relates to softness and hardness of matter, Mr. Grude?'
     Steely: 'That, from a sub-atomic perspective, my shit is composed of particles mostly vibrating at a higher rate than my piss.'
     Teacher: 'Thank you, Mr. Grude. Your deft articulation leaves little to the imagination.'
     Steely: 'You don't have an imagination.'
     Teacher: 'Well, congratulations Mr. Grude. It has been my pleasure watering yours.'

The teacher swarms off. A status bar appears on the projection wall as if loading something. When full, a dozen other desks appear next to Steely each with a student projection seated in them, creating trails with their movements. These projections seem almost real. Unlike the microcosm whose projections are light based, the students' apparitions are hard particle nano projections whose touch have a light weight, thus they can interact with the physical world on a low level. The teacher re-materializes.

     Teacher: 'Grad students, the last movie of your lives here. ""Giant""—1956. Enjoy.'

Steely looks down at his desk. His microcosm is developing well, thriving. There are 64 life harboring planets in his system. He looks through his scope. He monitors his gauges, adjusting tension and gravity here and there.

Steely receives a tummy rub via instant messaging from Shoobie, and a pouty face. He replies with a blush face. The movie plays and a couple of the students are watching. The class is 50/50 male to female. A swirl of different races and creeds. Someone's nose starts bleeding. A Japanese student crinkles plastic in a Russian girl's ear to annoy her. Two students are reading palms. Steely extends his hand, taps a blue eyed Korean kid named Kio.

     Steely: 'Howdy'
     Kio: 'Listen. It's out of control. My parents are hiring a load of lifeguards for this weekend. Apparently someone drowned last year at the pool party I've never had. Been on my Kegel exercises since last week.
(Kio's projection spreads hair on Steely's scalp with his swarm fingers and examines it before Steely shakes him away)

     Kio: 'Your hair is so clean?'
     Steely: 'Kio—get off.' (Doesn't move. Focuses his sight through the scope down into the microcosm.)
     Kio: (Speaking out loud) 'Western hygiene has lacked as fuck—these guys look dank.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Close your mouth!'
     Kio: 'Only if you keep yours open.'
     Blonde Girl: You're small.'
     Kio: 'She didn't talk to me like this last night. I'm so confused. This sucks.'
     Blonde Girl: 'Do you know I can hear you? What was last night? I'm in Morocco.'
     Kio: 'Last night, last month—whenever this loud sex was. I forget.' (Kio turns his head and is punched in the nose by Blonde's swarm hand.)
     Blonde Girl: (Warns) 'You are a small feeling. Do not!'

The downpour outside intensifies.

     Steely: 'She didn't like that one, Kio.'
     Kio: 'Bro, whatever, she's a lunatic, and she just got herself un-invited.'
     Steely: (Laughs and shakes his head.)

Dree, the Pacific islander student, taps Steely.

     Steely: 'That's TWO cartridges.'
     Dree: (Says 'okay' without saying anything.)

It thunders soon after a grand flash of lightning. Rain comes down heavier and heavier, then a black out.
The 3-D swarms of students and teacher disappear and the room goes dark. The glow of Steely's experiment is the only light source in the room. His gaze stays stuck on the system, its glow upon his face. Just then a message notice activates.

GROUP TEXT:

     Matthew: 'Anybody seen Robb? I think we lost Robb black ass.'
     Robb: A piece of me with always be inside of you.'
     Shoobie: 'lol' (emoticon)

Steely gets up from his desk, pulls his hoody over hid head and goes to use the urinals outside in the storm.

It's pouring as he walks toward a small shallow tower of urinals—they resemble a merry-go-round. He pisses with the rain falling on him hard. No one is outside. He washes his hands on a faucet above the urinal then heads back toward his class. Sunlight cuts through the rain. He gets back to his seat, soaked, and sits down in the naturally lit room. He looks down at his bowl for a moment, lights a cigarette and stares at it for a moment. Spinning it around and staring at the ember trails. The sunlight creates streaks across the classroom through the ceiling. He pushes everything back into a single point then folds the desktop back into the compartment.

Steely's eyes well up.Embed"

Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me

Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem with you and me

Instead it just rottens me, yeah, spoiled crazy

Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And we were harassed by police?

Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there’s no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can’t do this revolving door any longer

I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more

Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

Maybe it’s the ""me"" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that’s what made us close
And now that’s the very reason
That we’re slamming doors
But we’re both adults, it’s time we get over it

Boyfriend,"Boyfriend LyricsMy boyfriend drives a lil bucket
When it rain it fills up with rain
My boyfriend he gon pick me up
Don't distract him at the wheel
In his lane
He's the only one

My boyfriend he misses me when I'm gone
So he don't forget me
There's a song he sings
Calms his nerve, endings
My boyfriend is friendly
And we don't want no problems
I could say that I'm happy
They let me and my boyfriend become married
I could say that I'm happy
But cross my heart I didn't notice
Hope to die no never, we voted
Me and my boyfriend cast our ballot
Every kiss reads like a poem
Making wrongs right like a poem

I couldn't say I dream of you
Because my dreams are filled with no one
And all is lost
Me and my boyfriend we found
We don't hope for beyonds at all
Me and my boyfriend spend time
And that's all I'm holding on
This time

We got permission
Nothing's above condition
But this ain't a thang
It's a mission

Can't join the band so sing along
Me and my boyfriend got it going on
Sleep with fans and t shirts on
Asleep in vans your legs all strewn
Across my lap
Tan lines where your watch was strapped
You took off to make time
Cut your hair
You left it so long
I love to stare
There's nothing wrong
And if I die while I'm asleep
I pray to God my boyfriend
Keeps my secret

Home.,Home. Lyricshome. i put my bag down. leave my shoes where they land. pull my shirt over my head. hang it on the ironing board. fall into this white nautica comforter my mom bought from marshall’s when she came in town to see me last. home is currently in beverly hills. a well executed renovation project not far from wilshire theatre. i like this place. rent’s two grand. expensive. refrigerator’s stainless. countertops are granite. living room floors are travertine. bedroom floors are hardwood. it’s a nice space. beige walls with nothing on them. but an ignorant television or two. a mural i did by hand when i was heartbroken and a completely arbitrary photo of odb in the bathroom above the toilet. my favorite piece. i got one closet and more articles of clothing than i need or wear. options are good. i’ve never been notably organized or tidy. so a large percentage of my wardrobe is usually strewn across my bed or that aforementioned ironing board. i keep my bathroom clean. kitchen too sort of. i eat out so much that the only issue i really have is perishables perishing in the icebox. oh and my fish died recently. i still haven’t emptied his tank. damn. a nice lady named mayra comes by a couple times a month and cleans up for me. it’s the best eighty dollars i spend everytime. i built out a project studio in my living room. the mess of wires is starting to become a nuisance though. i’ve probably recorded at home less times than i can count on my hands. i have made a couple beats though. beats which i’ve played for no one but frank. i’m reading three books at once. well not really. but you get it. which one i pick up at the end of my night sort of depends on my mood. i’m furthest along in the one about an african kid who moves to america after his family is killed and his country is destroyed by civil war. his story is hardly imaginable. i appreciate the relative calm in my life by the time i put it down. i used to be addicted to cnn. nowadays my tv is either off or being used as a monitor for my mac in the living room. except on sunday nights when entourage is in season. i read magazines a lot. they’re my favorite. i have no subscriptions. last time i counted i had near a thousand bucks worth of magazines stacked next to my sofa. newsstands must love me. i’m impulsive as fuck. damn. that’s bad. i’m gonna try and subscribe online somewhere or something. i’ve got a lot of music here too. lately i’ve been going to amoeba and buying oldies but goodies that i’d never heard before. i must admit those have been my most wise purchases this summer. smarter than my car note for sure. sade’s love deluxe might indirectly buy me a g550 one day. a house to park it in front of too probably. no bullshit. i’ll sleep now. maybe i won’t wake up till morning. maybe i’ll wake up shortly. either way i’ll pray. and i’ll dream.20Embed

Was stranded as fuck at the house
We just landed we scuffing the ground
We been knew the earth was around
These goofies ain't looking for Mickey
They looking for mini me, copy my style
Copies is selling and I don't know why
Mostly I cockblock myself on the pop

Tumblr Letter About Orlando Shooting,"Tumblr Letter About Orlando Shooting LyricsI read in the paper that my brothers are being thrown from rooftops blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs for violating sharia law. I heard the crowds stone these fallen men if they move after they hit the ground. I heard it’s in the name of God. I heard my pastor speak for God too, quoting scripture from his book. Words like abomination popped off my skin like hot grease as he went on to describe a lake of fire that God wanted me in. I heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month. I heard the gunman feigned dead among all the people he killed. I heard the news say he was one of us. I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a faggot as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist. Many are annoyed by our wanting to be married like everyone else or use the correct restroom like everyone else. Many don’t see anything wrong with passing down the same old values that send thousands of kids into suicidal depression each year. So we say pride and we express love for who and what we are. Because who else will in earnest? I daydream on the idea that maybe all this barbarism and all these transgressions against ourselves is an equal and opposite reaction to something better happening in this world, some great swelling wave of openness and wakefulness out here. Reality by comparison looks grey, as in neither black nor white but also bleak. We are all God’s children, I heard. I left my siblings out of it and spoke with my maker directly and I think he sounds a lot like myself. If I being myself were more awesome at being detached from my own story in a way I being myself never could be. I wanna know what others hear, I’m scared to know but I wanna know what everyone hears when they talk to God. Do the insane hear the voice distorted? Do the indoctrinated hear another voice entirely?3Embed"

Simply,"Simply Lyrics[Intro]
It's simple, so simple

[Verse 1]
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love
[Interlude]
My mother said ""son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple""

[Verse 2]
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me

[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Bridge]
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, cause they're simply too short
Without love

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel

Babe pass me that death tree and let me smoke please
At night you be in my room, don't care what city
You dyin' to catch my seed, take off and reunite
Don't freak like you desperate, shout out your exes
They dealt with your selfish type of aggression
I beat then I flexed it, that's my confession
I skeet just to exit off to your best friend

Breathe 'til I evaporated

Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night

And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor staring out my window
And seeing them right about to crash right into you
You marching on the sidewalk umbrella up
Oblivious no clouds shades on no sun
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

(Look up look up)
You better look all around

Could you take me to the hills
I’m not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try

We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
I’m spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
How you do it, and don’t ever let me down

Review of Kim Burrell’s “Home”,"Review of Kim Burrell’s “Home” Lyricsi was raised christian. only had a few friends from different religions growing up. these days i’ve got family from agnostic to islam. my grandmother was pentecostal evangelical. she brought much of that fire and brimstone back to her household. my uncle tony said the other kids teased him and his siblings, called them “holyrollers”. so as you may or may not expect, my mother was, and still is, less than imposing when it comes to a particular system of belief. i was a practicing catholic for a short time. me and moms started going to separate churches when i was like 13. i never sang or played in the church though, unfortunately. i remember being kind of intimidated by the idea of it actually. church was the hood julliard to me. all the coldest musicians came out of there. the lady in the video…summa cum laude.2Embed"

rivke asked: some background on that pic (from wiki): In March 1993, while on a trip to Sudan, Carter was preparing to photograph a starving toddler trying to reach a feeding center when a vulture landed nearby. Carter later said that he waited 20 minutes to see if the vulture would flare its wings. He finally took a picture and then chased off the vulture. However, he came under criticism for failing to help the girl:
The St. Petersburg Times in Florida said this of Carter: ""The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering, might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene.""
Sold to the New York Times, the photograph first appeared on March 26, 1993. Hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask the fate of the girl. The paper reported that it was unknown whether she had managed to reach the feeding center. In 1994, the photograph won Pulitzer Prize.
Carter later committed suicide. This photograph raises issue about photographers and their relationship to their subjects.

His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid

Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs

You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance

How come the ecstasy
Only depresses me so
Chemically I don’t have
Any new places to go
Every face looks pale

When they lower my coffin
Bet a few bitches jumpin in the hole
Few old ones that I left alone
I never lie cus I don’t remember
No tales cus it’s two heads

AT LUNCH WITH MY FAMILY..,"AT LUNCH WITH MY FAMILY.. LyricsMy aunt asked my moms if she won the lotto, where would she choose to live in the world. my moms said los angeles..my aunt asked me next.. i said africa. I didn’t think about it a whole lot, it was just the first thing that came to mind. I’ve never been to africa but i know it’s a big place.. so my answer wasn’t really specific. It probably wasn’t even honest. I don’t know. I’m starting to think america’s fucked. I actually started thinking that a while ago. I sense a lot of young americans feel this way too, there’s good reason. honestly, i just live here. i’m an american, sure, but it’s not really a choice i made for myself. if you gave me a map i could show you worse places to be born and better. but i was born here, i live here and it’s chill here. so maybe if i hit the lotto, i’d stay in los angeles too.. pay the taxes and buy mom a house out here

Granted, i’ll probably revise this after i see the world. but what if i don’t?2Embed"
Tumblr post on current life,"Tumblr post on current life LyricsI’ve been meaning to write you more. different hotels every night aren’t so bad really. in fact- all the moving house could inspire a photo series.. not for the gram, knowing me it’s probably only for whoever controls my estate in the future and enthusiastically develops all the rolls of film i forgot to. i’m in belgium, just 7 concerts into a tour with an ambiguous ending. i’d tour for a year if it didn’t interrupt my recording or my weekend driving. i really wanted to go to cairo in between europe and australia.. might let things settle some.. go to south africa instead and place some flowers on a gate for the president.for being epic and 94. i write on paper at night. my tour manager gave me a small powder blue book at the beginning of this run with gold embossed lettering on the cover that reads ‘one line a day’.. it’s easier than you’d think to narrow the entire cinema of your day into one sentence. i never read them back in the morning. whenever morning is.. even my macbook clock can’t keep up. all the travel isn’t in support of an album or anything like that really- past or ahead. there’s no label or touring firm dollars involved. all pennies from my pocket. in support of some odd daydream. ops to photograph crowds and clouds from planes. contrast all the quiet with some noise. new noise and old noise..sober crowd, faaded crowd. all welcome.Embed"
LIVING OR..,"LIVING OR.. Lyricsliving. it’s a plain difference from dead. seen a dead body this afternoon. the people who felt they had that body in their lives, have to let it go. the memories of the life that used that body are just as finite as the bodies of those who remember him. the woman or man that enjoyed that mans body, will only have the thin almost holographic recollections for as long as they live. then again, who knows how long we live, and if life goes on after these heartbeats stop. who knows where life went when it left that body. who knows if it went anywhere, not you. matters of faith, are matters of faith and faith is not knowing. what i know is that when i see a body without life, i feel sort of childish. a kid in a big complicated existence. a game with no rules and no point of winning other than for the sport of it. like the things i know and have learned mean nothing really. a feeling of confusion about the point. a bone chilling awareness of my mortality. still i wanna live. live and bring other lives into this world to live and die as well. some would say we are one consciousness divided. i would say we’ll find out. but we do not know that. eh. life. where’s my fuckin lighter.5Embed"

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 2)","Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 2) LyricsSteely is walking barefoot through a hardwood hallway into a kitchen space that is futuristic and primitive at the same time. The kitchen consists of a small pool of self-replenishing fresh water, light cleansers instead of soaps, a BBQ pit, a stone oven, cabinets that are refrigerated and store food, dishes and cutlery. The floor is perforated with vents that heat and vacuum the floor for debris. Potted plants are in the windows as well as above the pool of water. Steely takes two bowls out of a cabinet, a knife, two spoons, a jar of milk, honeycomb, and bananas off a hook. He begins to prepare one bowl of oatmeal and one bowl of cereal. He slices a banana on a wood cutting board, places the banana slices on top of both bowls, swirls some honey on the oatmeal then walks back through the hallway.

The hardwood hallway extends into a room where Shoobie is seated in front of a white desk with a translucent top that is eventually lit from beneath. She’s sketching schematics with graphite while 3-D printing small pieces of the design from the sketch paper directly. Steely places the cereal on her table and sits on a full-sized bed cornered against the far left wall. Steely eats and looks around the room. Photos and schematics are placed on the wall, bed sheets spill onto the floor and Shoobie’s wearing PE shorts, varsity hoodie, ankle socks and a messy ponytail. It’s a perfectly lived-in moment that feels right in the ways you’d hope for when two people comfortably cohabitate. Just then he noticed a message in his field of vision.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Matthew:  ‘wya? wyd?’
     Steely:  ‘I’m here man. breakfast.’
     Matthew:  ‘ole oatmeal eatin’ ass boy’
     Danny:  ‘all star suck me ups last night’
Steely: ‘who?’
     Danny:  ‘imma bring her and her friend out to the water.’
     Steely:  ‘oh, OK.’
     Mathew: ‘about to shower---’
     Steely::‘Yea, I gotta do the same rn.’
Steely puts the phone down and finishes his bowl of oatmeal. Shoobie’s cereal sits untouched where he placed it, getting soggy.

Steely returns to the kitchen, puts the bowl in a light wash rack. He pulls on a shallow drawer and grabs a refrigerated metal slate from a stack of four. The slate responds to his touch, turning transparent while a swarm of light particles activate a 3-D projection an inch off its surface, making a mold of his hand. Steely places his hand into the particle mold then gets up and walks into the bathroom down the hall, to the right, then left of two bathrooms. Steely sits on the toilet and begins to masturbate to a video now playing on the slate. The ground changes hue.

There’s a signal that class is about to begin.

     Shoobie: ‘I’m going to class.’
     Steely: ‘Should go together.’
     Shoobie: ‘Yea – what about yours?’
     Steely: ‘I wasn’t going to go in there till later.’
     Shoobie: ‘Irrational fears again?
     Steely: ‘Naw…’
     Shoobie: ‘They won’t let you come into class late…’ (Steely cuts her off)
     Steely: ‘I know.’
     Shoobie: ‘Truant.’ (Stares him down)

They kiss. Steely leans into it a bit and reaches under her skirt. Students are watching them. She punches him playfully in the chest and he backs off. Steely leaves Shoobie standing there, while he disappears down a decline, through a grove of trees.

Steely arrives at the entrance to a gated community, as behind him a bullet train hydroplanes silently along a narrow band of water. He lights a flavored cigarette, drops it on the ground by accident and picks it up, he puffs it to keep it alive as he walks towards a guard post. As he approaches, a woman in her fifties hangs her head out of the doorway of the security quarters. Her name is Florence and it’s apparent she knows Steely.

Florence works multiple locations as a security guard and as Steely has developed his hobby of breaking into cars, he’s also developed a relationship with Florence. She suspects what he does but looks the other way, treating him as a favorite aunt would. She has a soft spot for him and occasionally Steely brings her cigarettes or coffee or a flower picked up along the way.

There are two mesh steel hates. In front of the gates are a row of solid metal cylindrical posts that swivel up and down into the ground.

     Florence: ‘C’mon child.’ (Lazily)
Steely speeds up to a slight jog up to her half door/half window.

     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Put that out.’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘I’m proud of you. You know that, don’t you?’
     Steely: ‘Yes, ma’am,’
     Florence: ‘Give me a square, son.’

Steely goes in his parka pocket and hands two to the woman – she puts one to her mouth and lights it.

     Florence:  ‘Mmmhmm, go head on.’ (Turns an eye without turning her head.)

The gates clear, the posts lower.

Steely walks through the gates and down many stairs. Before exiting the stair well he stops to read a series of text messages from various senders.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Mia: ‘Another thought on perfection. The only problem with her is that she is too perfect. She is bad in a way that entices, and good in a way that comforts. She is mischief but then she is the warmth of home. The dreams of the wild and dangerous but the memories of childhood and gladness. She is perfection. And when given something perfect, it is the nature of man to dedicate his mind to finding something wrong with it and then when he is able to find something wrong with it, he rejoices in his find, and sees only the flaw, becoming blind to everything else! And this is why man is never given anything that is perfect, because when given the imperfect and the ugly, man will dedicate his mind to finding what is good with the imperfect and upon finding one good thing with the extremely flawed, he will only see the one good thing, and no longer see everything else that is ugly. And so...man complains to God for having less than what he wants...but this is the only thing that man can handle. Man cannot handle what is perfect. It is the nature. It is the nature of the mortal to rejoice over the one thing that he can proudly say that he found on his own, with no help from another, whether it be a shadow in a perfect diamond, or a faint beautiful reflection in an extremely dull mirror.

     Steely: ‘Sorry, I hope you feel better.’

NEXT TEXT:

     Steely: ‘You’re not athletic.’
     Clark: ‘We could line it up.’
     Steely: ‘You week, haha.’
NEXT TEXTS, STEELY READS BUT DOESN’T RESPOND:

     Unknown contact: ‘Have a day you dreamed of.’
     Andree (Pacific islander): ‘One more pak and I’ll drop it.’
     Kio: ‘BITCHES LOVE YOU.’

NEXT TEXT:

     Shoobie: ‘Who r u with rn?’
     Steely: ‘No one :/’
     Shoobie: ‘Matthew’s house? bored. misu.’

He finishes his correspondence and continues on. The stairwell opens to a strip where two wide roads sit, parallel but not separate. The left-hand road leads to a Cape Cod  style country club and what looks like a beach. Near the country club, a split in the main road leads to another wide, two-way road where the opposite directions are paved at different heights, like a shelf. There’s a black sand beach on one side and mature manicured hedges on the other; the tops of homes are visible. Steely walks down the road and as he passes a second block, the road narrows and inclines to a cavernous walkway that winds through the greater community.

A guys with a long curly afro, wearing a white hooded jacket with 3M accents, shorts, waist weights, and Nike running shoes comes out of a property. He jogs in place and does some light stretches. Steely walks up to the guy who turns out to be his friend Matthew, while casually running his fingers across the hedges. The two of them wave low and perfunctorily at each other then cross paths. Though there’s acknowledgement, it seems a bit clandestine as if they’re about to set something in motion.

Matthew jogs downhill with his arms outstretched and banks right into a still narrower canopied alley. Steely stays in place and keeps time. Matthew is now jogging perfectly center though a lane with mesh steel garage door every 50 years. He picks up the pace in his jog as you see the garage door open ten yards ahead – a white single-seater begins to speed out the garage but manages to stop right before hitting Matthew. Matthew acts startled.

     Matthew:  (Yelling at the Garten, and slamming his hands on the hood) ‘DAMN – NICE BREAKS!’

Matthew then jogs on following the car as it speeds in a straight line away from the scene till it’s no longer visible. Matthew hits a corner, makes a right and meets Steely back in front of Matthew’s house. They walk inside the yard gate through hedges and past fountains down a ramp into a cave like living space with an unobstructed view of the ocean.

They pass cleaning staff and art leaning up against the walls. Outside the window you can see where his yard slopes down to the ocean side cliff. There’s a pool with a high dive, a solarium, a lone, odd colored dog sits gazing at them as they walk through the house and towards Matthew’s bedroom. Matthew changes clothes quickly as Steely is talking to him about weed.

     Matthew:  ‘Fronto leaves?? – You act like you discovered fire.’
     Steely:  ‘You ever catch Mr. and Mrs. Hagen intimate – in their moment. I’d bet you haven’t, because they’re stuck with you. How free will they be when you’re out on your own? There’s a place for you in this world bro and I’m your friend, ok?’
     Matthew:  ‘You’re acting out now, you can stop.’
     Steely:  ‘Mrs. Hagen I’m sure is still very agile on that horse.’
     Matthew:  ‘You want some water or something?’
     Steely:  ‘Yea. Do you dance still. You used to be a good dancer. (Walks away to kitchen)
     Matthew:  ‘Pour my shake out the blender!’
     Steely:  (Calling out from kitchen) ‘Nah, you don’t have any ice!’
     Matthew:  (Calling out from bedroom) ‘Who the fuck said anything about ice?!’’
     Steely:  ‘Sorry, you know I really appreciate you buddy. I couldn’t find anything quite right for Shoobie’s birthday – everything’s so generic to her, she just scans it with her computer eyes.’

Steely walks into the bedroom again, Matthew is ready to leave. Steely hands him a shake and eats small pieces of fruit while finishing a blue can of Coke. The two of them exit Matthew’s room into an area where nothing else is in the shot apart from a right-hand drive Nissan Skyline from a hundred years ago and a small orange groove. Steely re-lights the fronto leaf blunt.

     Matthew:  ‘Put the fronto out. Drive.’

Later on the drive.

     Steely:  ‘I can’t think it’s too many notes.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s not on the 5 yet. That’s impossible.’
     Matthew:  ‘People are fucked.’
     Steely:  ‘He’s taking his time. How did he look when you ran into him?’
     Matthew:  ‘People are so fucked… Uhh, yea – he looked really happy to see me.’
     Steely:  ‘What are you talking..(cuts himself off)? Why are people fucked? That include you or nah?’
     Matthew: ‘People are just bad, like, toward other people. I should quit giving this traffic...but I can’t.’
     Steely:  ‘You gonna tell me something I don’t know?’ (Says this with the look on his face and not words.)
     Matthew:  ‘I showed you this already, but watch again.’ Handing Steely his phone to watch something.
     Matthew:  ‘When the lady gets sent to the neighbors house by her uncle to fight someone and she ends up running and getting chased, then falls down, breaks her shit and they set her on fire..’
     Steely:  ‘Yea, that hurt my feelings. She seemed to confident.’
     Steely:  ‘Did you listen to that Goye thing I told you about?’
     Matthew:  ‘Yeah. Are those lights new?’ (Looking at lights that follow the highway railing.)

Topography blurred outside the vehicle grass – suburbia and city overlapping – hyper color – non specific.

Matthew pulls into a sprawling office campus. We see a network of buildings, there are people from the company walking about engaged in conversation. One group in particular is huddled and highlighted.

     Colleague #1:  ‘Exploded?!’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Without heat?’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Yeah, or human shrapnel.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘So absent of heat, absence of residual bio and absent of our guy.’
     Colleague #1:  ‘He’s jumped on grenades before and lived.’
     Colleague #2:  ‘Chemiluminescence isn’t the mark of a grenade.’
     Colleague #3:  ‘Maybe saving the world a few times makes you eligible for dharmic ascension?’

Office campus is a ‘CAR FREE IS A CAREFREE’ zone – there is offsite parking for commuters.

Matthew’s car is stopped. They trade places at the wheel and Steely gets out. He walks towards the outskirts of the office campus. Matthew tries to pull unto the parking structure which is multi-level and underground. He begins to argue with the security person manning the entrance.

     Matthew:  ‘Why are you telling me I can’t park here?? It’s a free world.’
     Parking Security:  ‘Credentials please, sir? Sir. Sir. This is a corporate facility, credentials please.’
     Matthew:  ‘What’s the corporate ever done for me?! Huh? Since you know every God damn thing. What they done?? I should sit down right here and take a hot shit in the facilities.’

Steely walks down the ramp into the structure casually, trying not to be noticed – the distracted guard notices and chases after him shouting about credentials. Steely breaks into a sprint. Seconds later a small low flying autonomous aircraft is heard in pursuit of Steely down the structure.  Steely spot’s Garten’s car, the one that almost hit Matthew earlier, slides over the tip of it and almost falls of the edge of the parking structure which cascades into a waterfall, leading down into channels below street level.

Steely regains his balance and struggles with his car boosting key card, trying to gain access to Garten’s car. It isn’t letting him into the car and he begins to panic, but finally it clicks on – you can hear the whistle and the buzz of the security drone flying towards him. He slides down the seat so as not to be visible from the window. The drone flies to the edge of the parking structure and hovers, observing downward as the water flows. It then turns around and heads back to continue its search elsewhere. Just then Steely feels the vibration of an incoming message.

BEGIN TEXT:

     Unknown contact:  ‘Chase the rabbit three ways down, a ways to go.’
Steely:  ‘Who’s there?’
     Unknown contact:  ‘Do you have time?’

Steely’s baffled by the text but doesn’t have time to dwell on it, he starts the car and begins looking for another spot to park it, far enough from the original spot so as not to be noticed but still within the same parking structure. The perfect spot is three levels down. He carefully exits the car, makes his way into a common walkway towards a lift, gets inside though it’s crammed with people, and squeezes in amongst the plain-clothed engineers and corp. Employees all talking in code and oblivious to Steely.

Elevator doors open. Above ground it’s raining. Everyone braces for the rain as they exit. Steely puts his hood on and walks into an overpass. Billboards tower above it showing blue skies, a beach scene and a slogan that reads: “It’s June in Miami”. The rain continues pouring down, he’s still in the thick of the crowd. Steely exits down a ramp, jumps over a shallow ledge, walks under an overpass – there’s traffic speeding past him blurred – and begins to wait. Matthew pulls his car over, shining his lights on Steely. Steely gets into the car and steals the cigarette Matthew just lit from his mouth. Cars speed past going under and over intersections. A song played.Embed"

The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don’t let go
[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you’re not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That’s why I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 2: Nikki Flores]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don’t go
Baby, the worst jail is

[Pre-Chorus: Frank Ocean & Nikki Flores]
Waking up alone in a world where you’re not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I’m looking in your eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to youEmbed"

Hey let me tell you something

Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda'
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda'

You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib

[Verse 2]
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
(Cuz it's just for you)
I'm tryin to settle down
(Tell me who)
You know could make you smile
(Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who

Note on Plane Ride,"Note on Plane Ride Lyricscurrently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis. i wish i could talk to you all as friends. & im tempted, but the truth is you’re a mixed crowd. so i’ll spare the details… for now. unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far. i’d like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say. i don’t have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time. but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful? besides, i’m not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow, im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean i’ll be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than i’m used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial ‘ledge’. what do you think of this guy?1Embed"
Experiences,"Experiences Lyrics[Skit]
Something is wrong -

I don't really have a dick in my ass

Even joking about it, that something is wrong. Is that what you're saying you want? Oh my Lord!

[character chuckles hysterrically]

Is that something you said you would like to experience? There's nothing funny about it
Nah, I really don't want a dick in my ass

I mean honestly. No, no, no, but why would you even be joking like that here at this place?

'Cause I was just playing

You don't do that -

But I wasn't even talking 'bout myself, I was talking 'bout somebody else. I was talking 'bout how this one gay dude act

Okay, but what was this when you—when you first came up? African music as well as an African market

Come on cuz, I'm—I'm hungry cuz

Hold on. What is the African market?

White (Gentrification Mix),"White (Gentrification Mix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]

Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget
[Verse 2: Melo-X]

I forget 23, shit what year was that?
Nowadays life can fly by so fast like cars you see on highways
Watch 'em driving past, they all got a destination
Many elders say that you should focus more on the steps that's takin
To get there, but damn it's taking too long, been waiting so long
Now I feel like I'm breaking my strong
Ways of thinking about the reality of this industry
And exactly what it takes for me
To get to where I want to be
If trees could speak
They would talk about these brand new humans that came around
Building things that brought smog around
Now, how's that for gentrification?
While I'm patiently waiting the arrival
Of real shit that goes viral
I speak to those with they eyes closed
Tell 'em open 'em up
Sit, back, relax and tote on a blunt
Frontin' like I been sober for months
Last night I was in the club laying drunk
Screamin' out what the, huh
Yeah you know the word
And at the end of the day I'm just tryin' to be heard
Ya heard

This Is Mom,"This Is Mom LyricsRosie Watson introduces herself by saying her son inherited ""the gift of the gab"" from her. And she comes correct; within moments, a stream of stories, pearls of wisdom, life lessons and mottos flow freely, with a cadence and rhythm that's almost song-like. Born in Louisiana, raised in LA, she's the devoted mother of Frank's good friend Jonathan. Rosie refers to Frank (aka ""Lonny"") as her nephew, and is also called ""Auntie"" by the likes of Syd the Kid and Tyler the Creator.

""With Lonny,"" Rosie recalls, ""he had that drive towards being successful. And certainly they spent enough time in Sydney's studio to make a lot good music together, and they did. I was a lot more worried about Tyler. I remember chasing him around the house saying 'Tyler, I think you're crazy, I think there's something seriously wrong with you.' And I remember Lonny was there and said, 'Auntie Rosie, let me get this clip!' I said, 'You better not!'"" She laughs. ""I had curlers all in my hair. And he wanted to get this on film!""

With a big heart and warm personality, Rosie's quick to take others on as her own, and give Frank the same maternal care and advice that Jonathan reaps, as heard on 'Not Just Money' and interlude on Channel Orange. she also has a particular flair for voicemails: She makes another guest appearance on the new album, with a voicemail that warns of flesh-eating bacteria that's roaming rampant on college campuses.

Sat in an IHOP where the waitress knows how she takes her coffee (extra hot for the first cup), Rosie comes here often to study, currently in graduate school for Psychology and Therapy. Though she can chat for days, she's an equally good listener, and an acute observer, the result of 27 years working as a probation/parole officer in Los Angeles. Dressed superfly, with a sharp sense of style (due to her daily routine she calls ""prep before you primp"") Rosie brings us into her world and tells it how it is.

Interviewer: How did Frank and Jonathan meet?

Rosie: They met through Eddie and Raymond, they are also my nephews. And then Jonathan introduced Lonny to Sydney. That's how they came together, musically and creatively. They would meet at Sydney's house in high school, and they would compose music. And they just loved it; they just had a wonderful time. And I stayed on Lonny: ""Lonny, get my son home by curfew!"" I made him five me his cell phone number, and I would fuss at him. I kept him running for sure.
Interviewer: Your voicemails are stuff of legends. What do you love about leaving people messages?

Rosie: I think when you call someone, you should leave a voicemail for them. But with my son, I do leave voicemails for him, I'll often leave inspirational voicemails. Sometimes I leave nasty voicemails too! And I'll leave nasty voicemails for Lonny too, when the timing is right! I want them to always remember to just be themselves, they don't have to be the type of man described in a rap song. They don't have to be balling, they don't have to be ballers, they don't have to be shot callers. I leave voicemails for my son in particular because I want my son to remain optimistic. I want him to know that his mother has his back, no matter what. I want Lonny to also know that Auntie Rosie is here for him.

Interviewer: What's the last advice you gave to Frank?

Rosie: When I last saw him, he came by the house, and he was in this beautiful...Porsche I think it was? Sedan? It was gorgeous. And I said, 'Remember in life, you have to have both swagger and sway. With swagger alone, you're convincing yourself that you have something that you really may not have, and that others don't see in you. sway is knowing what to do with that swagger. Sway is influence. It's persuasion, and I shortened it to sway. You have to believe in yourself, but you also have to impart that confidence in such a away that you convince other people to believe in you, and take a chance on you. In life you've got to have both swagger and sway. Remember that.' He laughed and said, 'Okay Auntie, I'll remember that.' And I said, 'By the way I am going to trademark that statement! It's a Rosie original.'

Interviewer: Are you into cars as well?

Rosie: I really do love cars. I drive a 2006 Chevy HHR, and I love that little care. That's the longest I've ever kept a car. Normally I would keep a car for only two years, because I love different cars. Although now I have a KIA Optima, which I'd bought for my son to drive when he was in college. KIA and Hyundai are sister companies, and I find they make very good vehicles. As a matter of fact, the car that Rodney King, black in 1992, outran the police in was a Hyundai. Imagine - this funny looking black man, in this this funny sounding car, outruns the police. You know that made them angry! So even then in 92, the Hyundai was a very good car. It was very fast. I love cars. I have to wash and vacuum my car every week, because somehow I see the car as an extension of me. They seem to drive better when they're clean! There was a commercial - I believe it was for Cadillac - and it said ""when you turn your car on it should do the same for you."" I also owned a Cadillac, an Escalade, several years ago. And my motto was: ""When you in a Cadillac, you know where you in a Cadillac, you know where you're at."" They're wonderful cars.

Interviewer: What was your favorite ever car?

Rosie: I would say my Chevy Camero. I was younger of course, it was red, it was fast. Of course I appreciate the Pinto that my mother made my sister hand down to me, I think it was a '74 Pinto. But the Camero was the car that I bought for myself; it was my first brand new car. And it lasted: I had over 100,000 miles on that car.

Interviewer: What are your thoughts on social media and the younger generation?

Rosie: I do believe that they are, in many ways, in a good place. I believe that social media is a medium by which they do communicate with one another, and also become activists in many ways. It truly is an opportunity for activism. However I also do believe that it can also be very destructive in the sense that it can derail their focus. Forms of social media are potentially very addictive. And they can consume too much of your time to the point that you are too concerned with what other people think about you. I do believe that people that use it have to know how to use it, and hot to limit its  use.
Sometimes I'd hear my son laughing in his room, so I'd walk in his room and say, ""What's so funny? What are you laughing about?"" And he would say, ""Mom, I'm talking to my friends."" And I'd say, ""You're not talking to your friends, you are typing to them."" I would go and get the house phone and bring it to him and say, ""Here. Call them. Hear their voices."" I also told him this: ""Do not ever ask a girl for a date through text."" If a guy ever asked me for a date on a text, I would probably text back something very unkind, with an exclamation point!

Interviewer: Do you use social media yourself?

Rosie: I don't know how to Tweet. No, let me say this - I sent a tweet  a couple of years ago, maybe a year and a half ago, to MC Hammer. Somehow I got a tweet from MC Hammer, and I tweeted back to him somehow in my reply! That was my one and only time. He had been arrested by the police - it was profiling. I said to MC Hammer, ""Remember this. The lesson that's to be learned is the police officer's lesson to learn. It is his lesson to learn that not all black men are thugs, and that you can't judge a book by its cover."" Actually there's one thing I'd like to be able to use social media for! With Micheal Brown having been killed in Ferguson Missouri, there's one tweet I would love to send out. I believe that this jury is not going to come back with an indictment of Darren Wilson. I believe that so much time is elapsing now over this entire case, I believe there's a lot of corruption going on in the investigation of this case. One Tweet I would like to hear the crowd shout out is: ""We know about the wait, they're getting their lives straight!"" I would love to have someone tweet it for me and say, ""Auntie Rosie said that you all need to shout this out!"" I believe that they are delaying the investigation of this case because they're getting the stories straight. So - we know about the wait, they're getting their lies straight. Although I'm a peace officer myself, I believe that we have to respect people, we have to be respectful to their rights, we cannot become so intoxicated with our own power that we in fact think that we own the world and we run it, and everyone else is just a guest. We have to stay in our place too; we have to stay in our lane.

Interviewer: What's some advice you'd give someone reading this magazine>
Rosie: Don't confuse stability with stagnation. In life you want to move towards stability. The stability is what you want in your family life, it's what you want in your job and career. Don't look for excitement in everything you do; we have to be able to live and contend with boredom. But that doesn't mean that you're stagnated. Remain inspired throughout life, curious, moving forward. We should not be afraid to risk, to take a risk. We should have courage.

Interviewer: What's the best advice someone gave you?

Rosie: I remember the encouraging words of my mother, who would always say - the sky is the limit. Her life was certainly not an easy life, being a black woman coming from the south. She raised five children on her own because my father also passed away, when I was a little girl. So my mother raised five children on her own, cooking and cleaning houses for other people. She did not have a formal education but she was one of the smartest people I knew. She was very bright, Very intelligent, and she always imparted optimism in us to do our very best.

Interviewer: What's important to you, in becoming a therapist/psychologist?

Rosie: As a therapist, and as a clinical psychologist, we are the agents of change. I believe that we should never give up on life. We certainly are all interconnected in life, and we all need each other, regardless of our race, creed, color, regardless of our nationality. My life - and how I interact with people - is not a zero sum game, in the sense that my gains are not your losses, my losses are not your gains. I feel that my gains can help you win, and your gains can help me win. And so we all need help from one another.Embed"

And right when I was about to get up
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

So easy to love

The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

[Verse 2]
You said you’re feeling ways
That you never could’ve felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you’re kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive

What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

Tumblr post on Perseverance,"Tumblr post on Perseverance LyricsNO MATTER HOW DIM IT GETS WHEREVER I AM

I never quit working. I work in the dark cause work is light. I tell my work all my problems because it never gives answers i have already. It never edits without me. Doesn’t call me names. I give my work away, because it doesn’t cost me much. In fact i’m indebted. I work hard since life is hard. Death is a soft place, it can wait. But work ain’t love. And love ain’t work.

These Days,"These Days Lyrics[Interlude]
I ain’t never seen two pretty best friends
It’s always one of ‘em got to be ugly
So if her nails cost seventy dollars, make sure you give her fifteen hundred
I tell you, I’m so single, I don’t even charge my phone at night anymore
Imagine being beautiful and your man never posts you
The realest females don’t be wanting nothing but food, time, attention, and the truth
Got an ‘@’ in her name? She fo’ sho’ crazy
And let’s not talk about it, she got to A’s in hеr name *pfft*
If we’re dating, you arе not getting tired of me
Go get you an energy drink
Women swear they’re broke
Then all of a sudden here comes the UPS/Amazon truck
If that man is grabbing your booty pretending it’s big when it ain’t, that man love you
I only want it if I’m the only one having it
One thing about a pretty female, is she’s always gonna snore
I love me a woman that could slay one day, and then look homeless the next
Balance, baby
I know I’m a handful, but that’s why God gave you two hands!
It’s Halloween but I’m already dressed like the love of your life
If you love hard, stay single because people don’t appreciate it
I’m not coming second to nobody
I’m not even my mama’s second child!
Don’t be fooled, a man will talk down on a woman that he in love with
If I can’t see you seventeen times a week? There ain’t no point in us talking
A man’s whole family will stop liking you, just because he did you dirty
How many mothers always have their kids with them? I’ll wait
I tell you, I’m so single, I don’t even charge my phone at night anymore
Toxic people will do you dirty, play victim, and then try to convince people it’s you
The realest females don’t be wanting nothing but food, time, attention, and the truth
Disappearing is definitely a way of handling things

Hide my tattoos in Shibuya

Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good

Rollin' when you ride, poppin'
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight actin'
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, ""issa knife"" (Knife)

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 6)","Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 6) LyricsCut to Steely inside of a wide industrial lift. Steely's still inside the car, smoking another cigarette as the lift moves upward. Garten's car comes up through the floor, facing Shoobie. There's reflection on the glass behind her, faint speckles of light imply a city view in the distance. Shoobie's seated in a white swivel chair with large perforations. Wide white flooring with a desk complex. Neutral furniture. Fluorescent lights overhead in rails—glass all around. A potted plant caged with a bird. Shoobie sits there in the nude anticipating a party but covers herself once she sees the car. In disbelief she walks toward Steely but continues past him, covering her mouth as she stares at the vehicle.

Steely walks down a ramp into a living space, a bar that looks off into the distance. Outdoorsman photography and console portraits line a wall. A photo of Steely and his dad holding a catch by the sea, another of him climbing a half dome. There's a jellyfish aquarium. The seating area is an ecosystem all its own with more plants and contained living micro systems. He eats pasta and watches television. Once he finishes eating he gets up, undresses, grabs his recall device and heads to the bathroom. Steely walks into a yellow shower. A 3-D projection of a woman in blue washes his back.

Dunk. Break for the curb. Clark taps Steely on the ass, blows him a kiss. Clark shoves him. Steely stumbles and walks over to a vehicle parked on the side. Steely leans on the driver window and kisses the driver. Steely circles to the other side and sits in the passenger seat. Driver puts a dutch to Steely's mouth. Steely hits it. Steely and driver kiss blowing smoke out of their noses.

     Driver (Shoobie): 'Relaxxx...'
     Steely: (Shakes head) 'Awe man—don't do that—I don't even know how it started.' (leans in to kiss her again)
     Shoobie: 'Nope.'
     Steely: (Kisses her face still) 'What you do all day anyway? When'd you even get here?'
Shoobie ignores him, and changes a song on the playlist (she was his ride there in the first place). Steely crawls out of passenger window and talks over the car.

     Steely: 'So what's good for later? I need to shower.'

Matthew and Clark walk over to the car—Danny goes inside to shower.

     Clark: W'sup Shoobie.' (Kisses her on the cheek.)
     Clark: 'So you gon' draw my blood and I can't hit the blunt? You cold.'

Shoobie passes it to Clark.

     Steely: 'Imma be back later I left some shit in your house.'
     Matthew: 'What is it? I'll grab it for you now. You ain't comin' back. Y'all are about to get weird.'
     Steely: 'What an angel—but naw, imma come back though.'
     Matthew: 'Smiley faces...'

Wide road. Canopy of live oak trees and filtered sunlight. Low radio. Engine noise layered with shower scene. Engine noise. Love scene. Engine noise. Cut to black.

Steely is high off endorphins while his back is being rubbed by the lady in blue. He finishes his shower, heads to his bed and crash into sleep. Steely's blurry eyes open up to Shoobie lying next to him with the look of Christmas morning on her face. It's 5am-ish. The glass now gives the views pass up on the level. Shoobie has been dealing with Garten's vehicle for the last several hours.

     Shoobie: 'The majority of Garten's designs contain two access points. It's a motif of his.' 'This design in particular has nearly complete function solely from one key point. The second key point is hidden. I got its location off this thing's own thoughts. Whatever, take a seat.' (Pointing to the car)

Steely takes a seat. Black cup of coffee in his hand. Shoobie has a rainbow coil of wires running from a handheld device into a port on the headlight of Garten's car.

     Shoobie: 'Wait for it.' (As she works)
In a moment Steely's vision through the windshield glows and the city past the woods falls off into sky. His entire surroundings glow golden and white and the edges of his view fall off into endless sky. He seems to be on an island, floating high above any water. Steely jumps a bit, spills the coffee on his boxer shorts. It takes a moment for him to feel the sensation.

     Steely: 'Fuuuck....'

Steely jumps out of the car. Pulling off his burning shorts, eyes affixed to the fantastic view, which is fading back into reality all around him. His vision goes back to normal again. Shoobie smiles. Steely starts to wring out his shorts when he gets a new message notification.

Big Enough,"Big Enough Lyrics[Intro]
Mafia
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down
Like a seesaw let you down
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger, woah

[Verse 2]
Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger, you bigger, woah

So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
Cause I got a little style goin'
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if, they're, just like you
[Chorus]
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 5)","Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 5) LyricsSteely walks up to the parking structure of the corporate campus where Garten's car is located. Florence is manning the security desk. Looks on at Steely knowingly. This is one of Florence's gigs.

     Florence: 'C'mon.'
     Florence: 'Don't get yourself into anything you can't get out of child.'
     Florence: 'Gimme.' (Pointing at the bulge in his pocket.)

Walks past security into the empty underworld of parking levels—few overnighted vehicles here and there. He goes to where he left Garten's car and gets in. He pulls out a box of smokes and reads the warning label. He smokes a cigarette and begins looking at his teeth in the mirror. Garten's keys are inside as before. He starts the car. He drives normally, calmly, making his way off the corporate campus onto the highway, and getting off at an exit leading to a neighborhood nestled by woods. There is a subdivision ahead of him comprised mostly of high-rises. There's a lake passed.Embed"

"Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 4)","Godspeed Screenplay (Episode 1, Scene 4) LyricsSteely's eyes are watering from the wind rushing in his face as he's smiling, then laughing, going full throttle on a speedboat with Shoobie, Matthew, Clark, Danny, Grad Girl #1, Rob, Grad Girl #2 and Grad Girl #3 in tow.

     Matthew (to Shoobie): 'So how'd you shut the power off? Generators didn't even come back.'
     Shoobie: 'No—I had a finals presentation.'
     Clark: 'Thought you handled your finals midterm'
     Shoobie: 'Extra credit.'
     Matthew: 'What are you?'

(Bonfire being set aflame on the beach)

     Robb: 'They're gonna shut that down any moment now'
     Grad Girl #1: (Eyes Robb while he takes off his clothes and puts on his wet suit.)
     Robb: 'Yea. I'm tryna get fit. So what. Swim.'
Robb pulls Junior girl #1 back into the water while the boat moves at a slower speed. Underwater shot shows Robb on a wake board being pulled by an aluminum speedboat. We see the turns and the flips and the fun.

     Matthew: 'I'm Shamu!' (Heard from underwater.)

Junior girls push Matthew and Danny. All fall in.

Sun going down—having brews—group talk.

     Robb: 'Always thought he had the better things.'
     Matthew: 'Kinda did.'
     Steely: 'Better looking staff, and the crazier grounds.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'I heard you have a woman in your shower who washes your back.'
     Steely: 'She's not a real woman.'
     Danny: (to Shoobie) 'When do you have to be over there? I heard that building is nuke-proof.'
     Shoobie: 'Yeah aren't they all now.'
     Danny: 'That's Central for you. Jesus.'
     Robb: 'You're not moving because of all this rain?' (Laughs)
     Shoobie: I've got all summer. The world's small. Day trips.'
     Steely: ‘Whole crew’s going different ways now.'
     Grad Girl #2: 'I'm taking over my parents' machine.'
     Grad Girl #3: 'You mean your parents' money.'
     Matthew: 'That's one thing that brings us all together, our parents' cash.. You too, my dear mid-caste offspring. Even you.'
     Shoobie: 'That's not what brings us together. But look, nepotism aside, I think you've done well for an underdeveloped intellect.'
     Matthew: (Grins in agreement) I would've quit this head job at first chance to climb locals and surf my life away. But the trust says I can't participate without taking my part in this ceremony.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'All I care about is world peace. All they taught me here was how to take notes.'
     Robb: 'OK, Miss Argentina.'
     Clark: 'I quite liked it here.'
     Steely: 'So that's why you didn't clear?'
     Clark: I cleeeaared.'
     Clark:Hey guys, listen. Alright, so. If I'm not fucking this person in person, but we get off to each other through the mesh all the time is it the same? Or am I trying to sell myself something? I asked em to take a job as my massage therapist to like simulate intimacy. Thought it was a long shot, but it worked out. It's been beautiful.'
     Shoobie: 'Who are we talking about?'
     Clark: 'That doesn't matter'
     Matthew: 'Is this person local?'
     Clark: 'Nah, isn't. It really doesn't matter guys.'
     Matthew: 'I think it's brilliant. Sounds perfect. Nothing left to be desired from my vantage point.'
     Danny: 'Hmm, I think it's nearly there. There's something missing that you might want—then again you might not want that at all.'
     Clark: Yea. It won't ever be like that.'
Steely drifts off imagining a frozen lake with another lake shining like stardust on its surface, the lakes reflecting a seamless white sky. White water.

Dream interrupted—RENNN RENNN RENNN!!! SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. An aluminum catamaran cuts through the water. Campus pull up on boats. Steely pours his beer out. Everyone hides their drinks. Water turns color.

     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'
     Grad Girl #1: 'It's drop day! (Yelling at the police boat.)
     Campus Police: 'Please dock all watercraft and exit campus beach immediately.'

Campus Police speed away back to the shore. Students throw bottles at the police boat. Rather than head back to the shore and wait for the police, Steely pulls away in a different direction. The Police re-engage and give chase. Steely beaches the boat by sliding onto a black sand beach. All the students jump off the speedboat and run up the incline making an escape with the rest of the party.

holding on two stone tablets with ten commandments
and a flower crown power couple propaganda phamplet
black panther and white panther you could run the jungles sleeping free on the tree branches no light pollution
look how slow all the life is moving once you get your heart racing

Key Words,"Key Words LyricsFrank Ocean: What do you think, or suppose, was before everything?

Christopher Chassol: (laughs) So basically you're asking me..., what I think? I think everything is possible. I think it can be whatever you decide to be; whatever you choose.

FO: Chris, what the fuck are you talking about? you don't understand the question.

CC: The question is what do I think there was before the Big Bang. So  I think you can decide whatever you want because we have no clue. We are not astrophysicists; they get religious at the end.

Om'Mas Keith: And this is why there will always be a God principle/ When you get to the point where you can't explain everything, the human soul needs to find something because we can't accept not knowing. I'm a scientist. Everything I fuck with has been proven. That's like everything in my life.

CC: Really? Proven?
OK: Right, maths and science. It's like, this shit is real! Only in business and creating though. In love there's no rules. In love, you'll never know anything. Business can definitely know things. You can look at statistics in love and all that shit too,  but you'll always derive the fact that you'll never be able to predict anything. I think in business you can use models to predict outcomes. More so that in love.

FO: Wo have you guys gotten the best commentary on yourselves from? Has it been your enemies or your loved ones?

CC: Well it's my girl, of course. I do music to please girls, you know? At the beginning you do it for her to love me, because I want to shine in front of her.

OK: Like a diamond.

CC: I'm doing music for her to feel proud of me.

FO: You know that song, ""shine bright like a diamond?"" You don't know that song?

CC: No, it's from a movie? I don't know? Maybe-maybe - it's a girl? Like Miley Cyrus? I don't know I'm not an entertainer.

OK: My mother used to always say weird shit to us, basically saying like we were a very select group of people in the hood who had some consciousness and were trying to get out. And she would always make those weird statements to reinforce that, I don't even want to repeat what she said because it doesn't sound good. Basically, telling me that I should rise above what was going on in the neighbourhood. To this day, just how ambiguous your parents or elders around you can be, my mother, my grandmother, they'd always say stuff like 'you're from here, but you're not of here.' Just a repeated mantra, always. 'Each one, teach one.' so when I talk to my mom it's all these paraphrases and lessons. When I talk to my grandmother , it's always this wisdom. Everybody older than me are the ones who really give me the commentary as I move forward.

CC: When we were talking, I was thinking of echoes in your life or phrases that people say when you are young... Phrases that stay. Short ones that constitute your vision. There was one guy, I was 20 and in a band. I was good, but I was not super good. The guy was and older guy in a bar. He said, 'Yeah, pretty good, your concert, but you don't have the sound.' I was really pissed off. I knew he was right and this phrase - I don't even know who this guy is, I met him ten seconds - but this phrase stayed to remind me that I'm not there.

OK: I had one guy do that. This is a pivotal moment in my beat-making life. I was 16, I made these beasts and prepared them for this gentleman called Weldon Irvine who was a famous jazz musician. He came to my house, listened to my beats, and I knew they were great but he shot me down, like 'yeah they're a little busy bro.' It was my first shit of honesty that prepared me for what was going to come for the rest of my life. I always go back to that one scenario of people having that one opinion. You can let it destroy you, you have to add it to your repertoire and think about it. When he said that, I thought to myself, maybe there's a way to do things simple. I'm still on a quest for that to this day in my life, that level of simplicity, because of this interaction with Weldon.

FO: When I used to sing when I was younger, my mom would be like, 'stop hollering!' It used to make me all self-conscious about how I sounded, like my tone of voice or how loud I was, and I didn't want to sound like I was dying and shit. And then I discovered Prince at my mom's friend Jheri's house, I mean she used to have him on like everyday and I honestly didn't pay attention at first but I vividly remember the first time I heard 'Beautiful Ones' and this grown man singing for his life. Immediately I remember it clicking like , 'oh, it's okay to holler and scream and everything. Like, express yourself kid... Go off! So yeah, Prince basically made it all okay. (Laughter) And I mean there was other stuff like my grandfather always correcting my speech, which was a regular thing. But for some reason I remember I was picking up a habit of saying, 'yes, indeed.' And like really stretching it out too which sounded country as hell. I think I was picking it up from my older twin cousins or whatever and he wasn't having it, at all. Low-key I think he's the reason why I never picked up a strong New Orleans accent for real, which I kind if wish I did. I guess I could turn it on if I tried to but yea in general I probably just sound like I'm from anywhere in America.

OK: Talking like black people, what does it mean?

FO: Yeah, I heard that growing up sometimes. 'Oh, you talk white.' But you know what it means though.
OK: In the context that I grew up when I was told to talk white it was becuase I took the time to make sure everybody understood every word and used big words.

CC: It's about putting the white guy on the side of the intellect and putting the black guy on the side of the intuitive, primitive things. 'Oh, his language swings.' (snaps fingers). 'It's close to dance. Close to the animals, to nature!' The white  guys speaks clearly like the brain. It's doing this when people say 'talking like white people' and 'talking like black people.' It's so stupid.

OK: That's at the core. So why are people still doing that right now? Still! In fifth grade saying to another kid, 'Why you talk black?' Why you talk white? Wigger!'

FO: True. But it's all changing all the time. There'll be new cultures that collide like this in the future and this will be old news.

OK: Do you like being alone?

CC: Yeah, I love it.

OK I hate being alone. I love to have so many people around me, much as I can. I like to have people sleeping in my house.

CC: I like my toilet. I need my space.

OK: No, everything's separate. You can't use my toilet. (laughs) I like an environment where I'm in my world and there are people in the house, I don't know what it's about, but I like having people around me. I like entourage. I think I'm going to have a big entourage, really big.

FO: I'm not that way.

OK: You can be alone, huh?

FO: Yeah. I can be alone. But remember I used to have a bunch of people around my house all the time. All the time.

OK: Trusted crew, though?
FO: Eh, some randoms too.

CC: And people staying over and they wouldn't leave?

FO: Some people wouldn't leave, they'd just be there.

CC: So you're like 'so. so..' (claps hands on knees)'  'what are we doing?'

OK: Do people do this at your flat?

CC: Yeah, they stay because the place is good. So I'm like 'So so so... I have to work... blah blah blah.' They won't leave! Being alone is good. With this, the invention of the iPod, it changed everything. You have all things, all of this music everywhere. The Proustrian feeling, the feeling of nostalgia, you can bring nostalgia in a place where you have never experienced it before. You had Walkmans but the iPod changed everything.

OK: Data revival. That's what brings those feelings. Seeing it, it gives you unlimited... It's like fucking drugs, man.

CC: I love good nostalgia. Nostalgia that goes for a while. It's crazy when music is so powerful. It can still be technical and poetic, like 'I know which chord makes me feel about Wednesday afternoon in 1983.' Think like that. You could almost make an Excel document about it.

OK: Take for instance, every time I hear 'Don't Forget About Me' from the Breakfast Club. Whenever I immediately hear that song, I get this immediate image of being; because the only time I saw this movie was on WPIX11 [news] in syndication and it would come on Saturdays once every three months or something like that... But I always remember catching it at home on a Saturday, 11 years old. It takes me right back to that time, every time.

Zing Tsejeng: Do you think people are mostalgic these days?

OK: I don't know.

CC: No, I don't think so.Embed"

Tumblr Tribute to Prince,"Tumblr Tribute to Prince LyricsI'm not even gonna say rest in peace because it’s bigger than death. I never met the man (I was too nervous the one time I saw him) and I never saw him play live, regrettably, I only know the legends I’ve heard from folks and what I’ve heard and seen from his deep catalog of propellant, fearless, virtuosic work.

My assessment is that he learned early on how little value to assign to someone else’s opinion of you.. an infectious sentiment that seemed soaked into his clothes, his hair, his walk, his guitar and his primal scream. He wrote my favorite song of all time, ""when you were mine"". It’s a simple song with a simple melody that makes you wish you thought of it first, even though you never would have - a flirtatious brand of genius that feels approachable.

He was a straight black man who played his first televised set in bikini bottoms and knee high heeled boots, epic. He made me feel more comfortable with how I identify sexually simply by his display of freedom from and irreverence for obviously archaic ideas like gender conformity etc. He moved me to be more daring and intuitive with my own work by his demonstration - his denial of the prevailing model...his fight for his intellectual property - ‘slave’ written across the forehead, name changed to a symbol... an all out rebellion against exploitation.

A vanguard and genius by every metric I know of who affected many in a way that will outrun oblivion for a long while. I’m proud to be a Prince fan(stan) for life.5Embed"
RE: Last Night,"RE: Last Night LyricsNot funded by Gilead Sciences

Funded by Blonded, independently

Let’s just get that out of the way.

Club culture around late 70s and 80s nightlife in NYC was a special, much talked about and written about thing. From the star studded midtown clubs like studio 54 and the first danceteria to the downtown clubs like Mudd + paradise garage. The figures, the music, the looks, the lack of regulation haha. I recognize NY wasn’t all lasers and disco lighting and that simultaneously, there was a lot of crime and poverty and that a huge part of club culture, the gay community, at that time were being wiped out by HIV + AIDS. Now in 2019, there’s a pill you can take every day that will at a better than 90% chance prevent you from contracting HIV. This pill was approved by the FDA in 2012. The pricing strategy behind it is malicious in my opinion and so it’s public perception is marred and rightfully so. But the fact remains that despite price being a very real barrier to this potentially life saving drug for some, the other very real barrier is awareness. I decided to name, what was otherwise going to be a night of lights and music inspired by an era of clubbing that I loved PrEP+ because while designing the club which is inside of an old glass factory basement in Queens (shoutout to The Basement that runs a very awesome techno night on Fridays after us) I started to imagine in an era where so many lives were lost and so much promise was lost forever along with them, what would it have been like if something, anything had existed that in all probability would’ve saved thousands and thousands of lives. I’m an artist, it’s core to my job to imagine realities that don’t necessarily exist and it’s a joy to. A couple days before we threw the party, I was discussing this subject with my team and one of the architects I work with thought that PrEP as a drug had reached ‘100% saturation’ so far as awareness. I thought he was dead wrong so I asked a friend (who I won’t name haha) if he knew what PrEP was and his response was ‘isn’t that some type of viagra or something’. My ex who I was with for several years didn’t know about it when we first met at a gay club in LA. Awareness isn’t always what we’d hope it would be. But anyway, I’m ranting. I’m happy that folks are talking about the subject in the first place. Thank you to everyone who came out and danced with us last night. Y’all were beautiful and the energy was right! Thank you Bouffant Bouffant, Sango, Justice and Sherelle for your sets last night they were soo good man. Oh one more thing, I saw someone say that this was a PR stunt etc etc, pshhh bitch pls come get a drink next time and I’ll put several barstools out so you can have as many seats as you need. All my love everybody really. Stay safe.Embed"

Forbidden from the beginning

I'm not quite her speed or
Shows me her bares hands

Tell me I'm barely legal
But bareley legal

Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet

I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
